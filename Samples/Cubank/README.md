Apply Machine Learning techniques for a classification problem on TM1 cube data.

## Setup


1. Download full tm1py-samples folder
1. Adjust ```config.ini``` file in root folder to match you TM1 instance
1. Execute ```cubank_setup.py``` (can take ~5 min). Creates all TM1 objects and loads data into the cube.
